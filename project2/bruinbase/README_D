load() - The load function takes in input from a properly formatted data file and stores
it inside of the database. If the index flag is set to true then a B+ Tree Index will be created
and stored inside of a file titled <table_name>.idx. Then each tuple is inserted into the B+ tree
index.

select() - The select function takes in input an attribute, table name, and vector of 
SelectConditions. Our function uses two additional vectors, one for holding the equal 
conditions on the key and one for holding all the index conditions or other nonkey conditions. 
We go through each condition and determine what type it is and push it into the correct 
vector. We maintain a high and low search bounds such that we can search using the key 
constraints extremely easily. Then if we see that we need to use the index, we go through 
all the key '=' conditions and see if there are any violations. Next we start at the lowest 
bound for the index and readForward. On each tuple, we compare each of the conditions in the 
second vector. This part is extremely similar to the no_index_needed section as before. 

Edited locate() and readForward() functions in BTreeIndex.cc

Collin implemented the load functionality.
