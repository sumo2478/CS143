insert() - The insert function recursively inserts a new entry into
the B+ tree index. Initially a single leaf node is placed at the top of the tree.
Once this leaf node gets filled it will split and a nonleaf node root will be created
that points to these two leaf nodes. Everytime an entry is to be inserted we traverse
recursively down into the tree until we reach the leaf level. We then try to insert
the entry and if it is full we execute an insert and split. The insert function that called
it will see that the node was split so they will have to insert the middle key into its node
and so on and so on until the root node gets filled in which case a new root node
is created. 

The locate() function takes in a searchKey and cursor. As an output, it
returns the error code or 0 if no error. The cursor is pointed to the 
first index entry with the key value. We use a BTNonLeafNode to traverse
through the tree to get to the leaf with the index value of the searchKey.
The readForward() function takes in the cursor and then points the cursor
at the next leaf-node index entry in the B+ tree. We use a BTLeafNode and
use BTLeafNode member functions like read() and readEntry() to see if there
are any other entries after the passed in cursor.

Collin implemented the insert() and the associated helper functions.
Alex implemented the locate() and readForward() functions.
