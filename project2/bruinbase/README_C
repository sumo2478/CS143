insert()
The locate() function takes in a searchKey and cursor. As an output, it
returns the error code or 0 if no error. The cursor is pointed to the 
first index entry with the key value. We use a BTNonLeafNode to traverse
through the tree to get to the leaf with the index value of the searchKey.
The readForward() function takes in the cursor and then points the cursor
at the next leaf-node index entry in the B+ tree. We use a BTLeafNode and
use BTLeafNode member functions like read() and readEntry() to see if there
are any other entries after the passed in cursor.

Collin implemented the insert() and the associated helper functions.
Alex implemented the locate() and readForward() functions.
