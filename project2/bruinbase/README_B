BTLeafNode and BTNonLeafNode nodes are implemented for the B+ Tree.
Both the these classes are inherited from a BTNode base class.
BTLeaf Node stores its data inside of a buffer by storing the
key, pid, and sid for each entry into the node and the last 4 bits
of the buffer contain the next pid.
BTNonLeaf Node stores its data inside of a buffer by storing
PageIds and Keys. Starting with a PageId, the buffer alternates
PageIds and Keys ending with a PageId. These PageIds work as 
"pointers" to child nodes that could be other BTNonLeaf nodes or 
BTLeafNodes.

Collin implemented the BTLeafNode and Alex implemented the BTNonLeafNode.
