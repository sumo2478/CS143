BTLeafNode and BTNonLeafNode nodes are implemented for the B+ Tree.
Both the these classes are inherited from a BTNode base class.
BTLeaf Node stores its data inside of a buffer by storing the
key, pid, and sid for each entry into the node and the last 4 bits
of the buffer contain the next pid.

Collin implemented the BTLeafNode and Alex impelemented the BTNonLeafNode
