Movie Database:

create.sql   -- script for creating tables for the movie database
load.sql     -- script for loading data into movie database
queries.sql  -- script that contains three SELECT statements
query.php    -- PHP code that allows users to issue a SELECT statement
violate.sql  -- List of SQL modification statements (INSERT/DELETE/UPDATE)
             -- that violate each constraint

Collin handled the creation of the tables and loading of the data, while Alex worked on the Web Query Interface and the SQL statements. We both worked on the data integrity portion.
