Improvements:
- We could improve on the user interface and graphics of the website.
- In a team, we could have met up more often because there were times when there was a miscommunication about
  ideas; however, we extensively made use of version control through Git and Github.

Collin handled the creation of the search and browse pages, while Alex worked on 
the add information pages. We both did the Selenium test scripts on the pages that we wrote.
